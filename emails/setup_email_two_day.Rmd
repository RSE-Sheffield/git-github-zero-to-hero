We're looking forward to welcoming you to the RSE Sheffield training session on **git & GitHub through GitKraken
Client - from Zero to Hero!**


### SETUP

Prior to attending, you need to **install the software we are going to use and create an account on GitHub. <span
style="color: #d1410c;">Please ensure you have completed setup before the course begins.</span>**

Instructions on how to create the account as well as install all the software required can be found on the [**Setup
chapter**](https://srse-git-github-zero2hero.netlify.app/setup/) of the course materials. If you have any problems with
your setup, please get in touch with us for assistance *before* the course begins. To ensure you have the advantages of
a [GitHub Educational account](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/student_application) and GitKraken Pro for
free please see the [tip](https://srse-git-github-zero2hero.netlify.app/setup/github/) about using your academic email address.


### SCHEDULE

We’ll **kick off at `r params$event_start_time_day1` on `r format(strptime(params$day1, format = "%Y-%m-%d"), "%a %b %d
%Y")`** in **`r params$venue_day1`** and aim to have a few breaks throughout the morning, finishing
at `r params$event_end_time_day1`. The second session will follow **at `r params$event_start_time_day2` on
`r format(strptime(params$day2, format = "%Y-%m-%d"), "%a %b %d %Y")`**  in **`r params$venue_day2`** and follow the
same format.

There will be some time at the end of each day for questions and discussions.


### ATTENDANCE

**In the event that you can no longer make it, we please ask that you cancel your ticket so we can offer it to someone on the waiting list**.

<!-- **NB** Please note we will _not_ be in the same venue on the second day. -->

<br>

See you next week!

Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me with any questions.
