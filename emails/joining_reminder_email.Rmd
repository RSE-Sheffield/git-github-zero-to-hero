<!--- Send this email the morning of the event --->

We're looking forward to welcoming you to the RSE Sheffield training session on **git & GitHub through GitKraken Client
 - from Zero to Hero** shortly!

### SCHEDULE

Weâ€™ll **kick off at `r params$event_start_time_day1` on `r format(strptime(params$day1, format = "%Y-%m-%d"), "%a %b %d
%Y")`** in **`r params$venue_day1`** and aim to have a few breaks throughout the morning, finishing
at `r params$event_end_time_day1`. The second session will follow **at `r params$event_start_time_day2` on
`r format(strptime(params$day2, format = "%Y-%m-%d"), "%a %b %d %Y")`**  in **`r params$venue_day1`** and follow the
same format.

There will be some time at the end of each day for questions and discussions.



See you all soon!
