<!--- Send this email around 1 week prior to event --->

We're looking forward to welcoming you to the RSE Sheffield training session on **git & GitHub through GitKraken - from Zero to Hero!**


### SETUP
 
Prior to attending, you need to **install the software we are going to use and create an account on GitHub**.
 
Instructions on how to create the account as well as install all the software required can be found on the Setup chapter of the course materials: https://srse-git-github-zero2hero.netlify.app/setup/

If joining an on-line version of the course, we recommend using a two screen set up if possible so you can observe the live demonstration on one screen and complete the practical exercises on another.
 
### SCHEDULE
 
We’ll **kick off at `r params$event_start_time` on `r format(strptime(params$event_date, format = "%Y-%m-%d"), "%a %b %d %Y")`** and aim to have a 1 hr **lunch break at `r params$lunch_time`** . We will then break for lunch and return for the **afternoon session at `r format(as.POSIXct(paste(params$event_date, params$lunch_time)) + 1*60*60, "%H:%M")`** which should last around another 2.5 hrs. 
There will be some time at the end of the day for questions and discussions.

### ATTENDANCE

**In the event that you can no longer make it, we please ask that you cancel your ticket so we can offer it to someone on the waiting list**.
 
### COURSE DELIVERY PLATFORM
 
We will be using [Blackboard Collaborate](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/apse/digital/collaborate/students) to deliver the course. On the day please click the link below to join the course room:
