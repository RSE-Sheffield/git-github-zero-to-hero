## What is Version control? 

The **management of changes** to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information.

**Examples:**

- Numbering of book editions

- Wikipedia's Page history

<br>

### Where did it come from?

>  <q>The need for a logical way to organize and control revisions has existed for almost as long as writing has existed,  but revision control became much more important, and complicated when the era of computing began</q> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control>

#### Elements of a Version Control system

- Revisions are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the **"revision number"**

- Each revision is associated with a **timestamp** and the **person** making the change. 

- A &&new snapshot of a file is recorded** every time a change is made to it.

- Revisions can be **compared, restored**, and with some types of files, **merged**.
