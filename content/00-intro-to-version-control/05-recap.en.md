## Git, GitHub, & GitKraken Client

<br>

> Git, GitKraken Client, and Github are three separate things. Git is the system used for version control, but you don't have to use it with GitHub or GitKraken Client.

<br>

#### - **Git** allows you to effectively "save" your work at important points in time and come back to any of the save points.
 
#### - Sharing our work on GitHub allows others to inspect our work, make copies and contribute back changes. 

#### - GitKraken Client allows you to work with both from a single graphical user interface.
