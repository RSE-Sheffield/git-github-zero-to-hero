## Team formation

For this chapter, we're going to be **working in groups of 3-4 participants**. I'm going to allocate these groups randomly by sending you to break out rooms. Within your break out rooms, you will have **5 mins** to introduce yourselves and decide on a **group owner**. 

#### The group owner will:

- be the main administrator of the project 
- be the one that makes a copy of the template repository
- we will be working with setting up repository permissions and adding collaborators.
- will open issues for the rest of the team to work on.
- will be reviewing the code, merging pull requests and handling merge conflicts.

#### The rest of the team will:

- be assigned a specific task (issue).
- create a new branch to work in.
- follow the instructions in their assigned issue to complete the task in their branch.
- create a pull request from their branch to the new `main` branch.
- make any corrections requested by the owner.

## Complete team details

Once you have decide on a team repo owner, please copy the template provided in the course [collaborative notepad](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-CkHO417wtfJZ35X4q5tk_hcgP9W3mfEG5AsN2SIU1A/edit?usp=sharing) and complete your team's details

#### Template

## [OWNER] Make a copy of project template

The project we will be working with and contributing to will be based on the repo: https://github.com/RSE-Sheffield/python-calculator

The **project owner of each team will make a copy of the template** and the rest of the team will **contribute to their own team copy of the repository**.

To make a copy, first click on the {{% button href="https://github.com/RSE-Sheffield/python-calculator/generate" %}}**Use this template** {{% /button %}} button

For consistency, use the same name **`python-calculator`** for your own team projects.

Create your copy and the details of your team repository to the collaborative notepad so your team mates can access it.
