A **powerful tool for keeping track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects is the issues** feature of GitHub. You can access the issues associated with a repository through the <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> **Issues** tab.

They allow **storing conversations about tasks in the project repository**, visible to the whole team throughout the life cycle of the project, rather that them being buried in hard to navigate email chains! üíØ 

It's also **easy to see the status of tasks** as issues can be closed when completed, leaving the tasks still pending visible by default.

You can **write in markdown** so they are **great for having discussions around code**.

They can also be **assigned** to a specific team member, **labelled** and associated with specific project **milestones**.

## <i class="fas fa-user-circle"></i> Open and assign issues

To organise the tasks for each team member, **the owner will first open an issue for each person** which will contain detailed instructions on how to complete the task.

I've actually used a nice feature of issues to make this easy for owners called **GitHub Issue templates**. The markdown files that power the feature are stored in the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder of the project. Let's see how they work.

### <i class="fas fa-user-circle"></i> Open issue from templates

To create a new issue navigate to the <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> **Issues** tab 

{{< figure src="/images/ag-issues-tab.png" >}}

Click {{% button href="" %}} **New issue** {{% /button %}} 

{{< figure src="/images/ag-issue-init.png" >}}

Because we are using GitHub Issue templates, we are immediatelly presented with the 3 issue templates I've created. 

To demonstrate, I'm going to open the **Add subtraction function** issue. To initiate the process, I click on {{% button href="" %}} **Get started** {{% /button %}} next to the issue template I want  to open.

_You can override the templates and create an issue with custom content by clicking on_ ***Open a blank issue*** _at the bottom of the page._

{{< figure src="/images/ag-issue-sub-init.png" >}}

### <i class="fas fa-user-circle"></i> Inspect issue content

Because we're working from an issue template, the title and contents of the issue are already pre-populated.

The contents of this particular issue contain detailed step-by-step instructions on how to **add a `subtract` function as well as a test** to our `pythoncalculator` package. At the top of the issue there's also a **checklist** of all the steps involved which team mates can use to **keep track of and communicate their progress**.

The **special `-[ ]` list notation** means the **checkboxes will be interactive** when the issue is submitted.

When we're creating our issue, the main body contains two tabs:

- **Write:** were you enter the contents of the issue in markdown
- **Preview:** were you can preview what the content will look like when it is rendered once the issue is submited. 

Toggle the tabs below to explore this feature. Note how the checklist is rendered in the Preview tab.

{{< tabs groupId="issues" >}}
{{% tab name="Write" %}}
{{< figure src="/images/ag-issue-sub.png" >}}
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Preview" %}}
{{< figure src="/images/ag-issue-sub-preview.png" >}}
{{% /tab %}}

### <i class="fas fa-user-circle"></i> Assign team mate to issue

Now that I'm happy with the content of the issue (which needs no editing...aren't GitHub issue templates awesome?! üòú), I'm **ready to assign the task to one of my team mates**.

To do this, I click on **Assignees** on the top-right which launches a drop-down menu of team mates associated with the project and **select the team mate I want to assign**.


{{< figure src="/images/ag-issue-sub-assign.png" >}}

{{% notice tip %}}

You can **assign an issue to a team mate, add more or remove assignees at any point**, even after you've opened the issue. If your repo is public, **you can also assign issues to users who are not collaborators** on your repo. Just type in their username in the drop down menu textbox. 

{{% /notice %}}

### <i class="fas fa-user-circle"></i> Submit issue

Once I've assigned the issue to a team mate, I click {{% button href="" %}} **Submit new issue** {{% /button %}} to create it.

The issue has now been **opened** and given a unique number (in this case #2). 

{{< figure src="/images/ag-issue-sub-cmpl.png" >}}

{{% notice tip %}}

You can use the special **`#issue-number`** notation anywhere in GitHub's markdown (e.g. other issues, pull requests etc) to refer to it which will add a link to it automatically!

{{% /notice %}}

The issue is also now listed under the <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> **Issues** tab.

{{< figure src="/images/ag-issue-sub-list.png" >}}

## <i class="fas fa-users"></i> Resolve assigned issue

Now that tasks have ben assigned through issues, it's **time for team mates to get to work!**

Let's **follow an example workflow by one of my team mates**, bobturneruk, who will be tackling the _add a subtract function_ issue we I just opened and assigned to him.

### Example: Resolve subtract function issue

#### <i class="fas fa-users"></i> Create `subtract` branch

{{% notice warning %}}

**Make sure to create a new branch to start work in!**

{{% /notice %}}

To begin resolving the task, Bob **first needs to creates a new branch off the `main` branch** to work in. Before that, he checks that his **<i class="fas fa-laptop"></i> local `main` branch** is in synch with the **<i class="fas fa-cloud"></i> origin `main` branch**.

{{% notice tip %}}

If your <i class="fas fa-laptop"></i> local `main` branch is behind the <i class="fas fa-cloud"></i> origin `main` branch, **click on Pull <i class="fas fa-download"></i>** to pull the remote changes to your <i class="fas fa-laptop"></i> local `main` branch.

{{% /notice %}}

Start by clicking the {{% button href="" %}} **Branch** <br> **<i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i>**{{% /button %}} button and **giving the branch an appropriate name** (`subtract`).

{{< figure src="/images/ag-sub-branch-init.png" >}}

The `subtract` branch has now been created and been **checked out** (indicated by the fact that the the **<i class="fas fa-check-square" style="color:#7CFF7E; background-color:black; padding:2px"></i> <i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> subtract** branch in the **<i class="fas fa-laptop"></i> local** repository is now checked). 

{{< figure src="/images/ag-sub-branch.png" >}}

#### <i class="fas fa-users"></i> Add `subtract.py` file

The next step in Bob's instructions is to create a new `subtract.py` file in the `pythoncalculator/` directory and paste the code for the `subtract` function.

A nice feature of GitKraken is that, as well as a basic text editor, it also **allows us to create new files!**

To create a new file, **first launch GitKraken's fuzzy finder** with 
<img src="/images/command-symbol.png" width="2px" style="align:left; display:inline; margin:0;"/> **| Ctrl + P**

Next, type **File**. This launches a dropdown menu of action you can perform on files. Select **Create file**.

{{% notice info %}}

For more information check out the GitKraken documentation on [Adding a file](https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-files/adding-and-removing/#adding-a-file) and [GitKrake's fuzzy finder](https://support.gitkraken.com/start-here/fuzzy-finder/).

{{% /notice %}}



{{< figure src="/images/ag-sub-file-create.png" >}}

Next, **type in the path to the new file you want to create**, In Bob's case it's `pythoncalculator/subtract.py` and hit **Enter|Return**.

{{< figure src="/images/ag-sub-file-fun-create.png" >}}

This **creates the new file** and **opens it up for editing!**.

Next, **paste the function code** provided in the issue instructions and save,

{{% notice warning %}}

**Please paste the code in exactly as it is in the issue instructions**, even you find something fishy with it üßê

{{% /notice %}}

{{< figure src="/images/ag-sub-file-fun-edit.png" >}}

We now need to **stage and commit the new file**. Follow the steps we've been practicing and commit your file with an appropriate commit message (e.g `add subtract function`).

{{% notice tip %}}

Including the text `resolves #issue-number-you-were-assigned` will **link the issue to your pull request** and **automatically close it once your pull request has been merged!** ‚ú® Find out more, including additional keywords you can use to [link pull requests to issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-your-work-with-issues-and-pull-requests/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)

{{% /notice %}}

{{< figure src="/images/ag-sub-file-fun-stage.png" >}}

The file is now commited and we can see that **Bob's <i class="fas fa-laptop"></i> local `subtract` branch is ahead of the <i class="fas fa-cloud"></i> origin and <i class="fas fa-laptop"></i> local `main` branches by 1 commit.**

{{< figure src="/images/ag-sub-file-fun-commit.png" >}}

#### <i class="fas fa-users"></i> Edit `pythoncalculator/__init__.py` file

Next Bob needs to **add an instruction for the new `subtract` function to be imported**. To do this, he needs to **edit `pythoncalculator/__init__.py`**.

To open `pythoncalculator/__init__.py`, double click on it in the file finder panel.


{{% notice tip %}}

To see all files in the repo, tick the <i class="fas fa-check-square" style="color:#166de0; background-color:blwhiteack; padding:2px"></i> **View all files** box. You can also initiate file editing through GitKraken's fuzzy finder. More info on [editing files](https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-files/editing-files/).

{{% /notice %}}

{{< figure src="/images/ag-sub-file-init-edit-init.png" >}}

Once the file is open for editing, **add the import line of code from your issue to line 2 of the file**.

{{< figure src="/images/ag-sub-file-init-edit.png" >}}

**Save, stage and commit your changes.**

{{< figure src="/images/ag-sub-file-init-commit.png" >}}

#### <i class="fas fa-users"></i> Add `test_subtract.py` file

The next step in Bob's instructions is to create a new `test_subtract.py` file in the `tests/` directory and paste the code for the `subtract` function test.

To create the new file, **launch GitKraken's fuzzy finder** again with 
<img src="/images/command-symbol.png" width="2px" style="align:left; display:inline; margin:0;"/> **| Ctrl + P**

Next, type **File** to launches the file action dropdown menu. Select **Create file** and **type in the path to the new file you want to create**, In Bob's case it's `tests/test_subtract.py` and hit **Enter|Return**.

{{< figure src="/images/ag-sub-file-test-create.png" >}}

**Paste the code for the test** provided in your issue.

{{< figure src="/images/ag-sub-file-test-edit.png" >}}

**Save, stage and commit your changes.**

{{< figure src="/images/ag-sub-file-test-commit.png" >}}

#### <i class="fas fa-users"></i> Push changes and make a Pull request

The final step of the process is to push the `subtract` branch to <i class="fas fa-cloud"></i> origin and make a pull request to the <i class="fas fa-cloud"></i> origin `main` branch.


To push the changes, click on {{% button href="" %}} **Push** <br> **<i class="fas fa-upload"></i>**{{% /button %}} and accept the default name to create the `subtract branch on <i class="fas fa-cloud"></i> origin.

{{< figure src="/images/ag-sub-push.png" >}}

Next, on the left-hand navigation panel, hover over **PULL REQUESTS** and click on the {{% button href="" %}} **<i class="fas fa-plus-square" style="color:#7CFF7E"></i> Create pull request**{{% /button %}} button when it appears.

Configure the **details of the pull request** including the **source and target repository** (in this case your copy of the repository) and the **source and target branches**, in this case Bob wants to merge the `subtract` branch into the `main` branch.

If you want, you can also add the owner as a reviewer but in the next steps, they will go through the review process anyways.

Finally, at the very bottom, click on {{% button href="" %}} **Create Pull Request**{{% /button %}} to submit it.

{{< figure src="/images/ag-sub-pr-init.png" >}}

The **PR has now been created**, as indicated by the <i class="fas fa-code-branch" style="transform: rotate(180deg) scaleX(-1);"></i> symbol on the `subtract` branch label.

{{< figure src="/images/ag-sub-pr-cmpl.png" >}}

Now it's time for the project owner to **review your contribution**!
