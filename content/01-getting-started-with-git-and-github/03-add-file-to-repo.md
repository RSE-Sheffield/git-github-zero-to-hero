Okay! Now we need to do something with the repository. Let's start with a basic use-case and make a single file that lists some to-do items. The repository is just a normal folder on your computer where you can create and edit files like normal.

- Open the folder (repo) you have just created. In GitKraken, you can do this by going to `File > Open in File Manager`.

- Now create a file in this folder. Open your favourite text editor and use to create a new *TODO.txt* file.

- Hop over to GitKraken again. You should see the new file you added!

- Now it's time to **commit** you work. This is creating a *save point* you can come back to at any time. Aim to do this whenever you've done a small, complete chunk of work. GitKraken provides an easy to use interface for this job:

    - __Unstaged Files:__ Here you have a view of all the local changes of your repository. You can also see the changes done to each file by just clicking on it. You have the option to **stage** all the changes or some of them. Staging is essentially a commit preparation process.
    
    - __Staged Files:__ All files or folders which are selected to be committed will be moved in this area.
    
    - __Commit Message:__ Commit creates a save point and every save point should have a title as well as a small description so we know what was done and why. Remember some projects last for years and many other projects will spawn in the meantime. So when we revisit an old  repository or we want to go back in time to find a specific change we should be able to do that with minimum effort!
    
    - __Commit changes to n files:__ Pressing this button will commit our changes *to our local repository*.

- 	Now that we have commited our changes locally we can **push** them up to the remote repository. This is done by pressing the **Push** button on the top of GitKraken navigation bar.
