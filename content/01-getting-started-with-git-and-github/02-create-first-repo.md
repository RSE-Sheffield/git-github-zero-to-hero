## Creating your first repository

When a local directory becomes **initialised with git**, a **hidden `.git` folder is added** to it. It's now called a **repository**. You can initialise an existing project with git or a start with a completely new project. We'll start by creating a new repository.

- In GitKraken Client, make sure you're logged in to GitHub.

- Create a new repository (`File > Init Repo`)

- You will be presented with a new GUI with a bunch of options. To initialise a new repository and create a linked GitHub repository in one step, choose the GitHub.com option.

	- __Account:__ The account in which you want the repository to be created under. This can be your account or an organization that you have access to.

	- __Name:__  The name of the repository, let's say _git-lesson_.

	- __Description:__ Optional, but every repository should have a small description!

	- __Access:__ Public or Private.

	- __Clone after init:__ This checkbox tells GitKraken Client to clone the resulting GitHub repository. This essentially creates a local copy of the repository at the path you specify next.

	- __Where to clone to:__ Select the folder where the repository will be cloned to. Let's say _D:/GitHub_.

	- __Full path:__ This should now be _D:/GitHub/git-lesson_

	- __License:__ A license is mainly a list of permissions specifying how other people can use your code. For example you may want others to use your code but only if they accredited you. [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) can help you choose the right license. For open source repositories MIT and GNU GPLv3 are usually appropriate licenses.

- Let's have a look at: 

	- the repository's history in GitKraken Client, 
	- our local version of the repository and 
	- the repository in GitHub.
