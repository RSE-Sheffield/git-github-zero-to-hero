### **Clone a repository using GitKraken** 


<br>

#### **Clone your fork**


<br>

Now that you have a fork in your account, let's clone it (ie download a local copy) through GitKraken.

To start clonining, go to: `File > Clone Repo`

In the **Clone** panel, select **GitHub.com** from the source panel. The right-side panel allows you to define the final details of the clone:

- __Where to clone to:__ Select the folder where the repository will be cloned to. Let's say _D:/GitHub_.

- __Repository to clone:__ Here you'll see a list of all the repositories you have access to and which you can clone. Choose the repository named _collaborative-github-exercise_.

- __Full path:__ Here GitKraken will show the full path where the repository will be cloned to. This will be _D:/GitHub/collaborative-github-exercise_.

When you're done specifying what and where to clone, click on **Clone the repo!**. If everything worked, you should see the following screen:

Click on open **Open Now** to view the version control activity associated with the project you just cloned. Git has been tracking the full history of the cloned repo, including all the changes made and who they were made by.

The cloned repository contents should look like so:
