So far, we've learnt how to **create repositories, commit files, and push/pull the files to a remote source like GitHub**. 

Here we'll **practice collaborating with someone else**. 

## Forking, cloning, and pull requests

If your code is online on GitHub and has an open licence, anyone can [**fork**](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to **make a separate copy of** your repository, [**clone**](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/cloning-a-repository) their fork to **create a local copy** on their computer it and work on it. 

Once they have made changes and pushed them to their own fork, they can then **submit their changes to your repository** by making a [**pull request**](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
