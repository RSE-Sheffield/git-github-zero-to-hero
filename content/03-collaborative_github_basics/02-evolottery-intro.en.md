###  **Welcome to the evolutionary lottery of skull and beak morphology**

> [**Beak and skull shapes in birds of prey (“raptors”) are strongly coupled and largely controlled by size.**](http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/99452/1/Bright%20et%20al.%202016_SelfArchive.pdf) _Bright, J.A., Marugan-Lobon, J., Cobb, S.N. et al. (1 more

## Exercise aims

- Each participant will **fork a GitHub repository**, and **contribute a file** required to simulate the *evolutionary trajectory of an imaginary species' body size*.

- We'll use **GitHub to merge all contributions** and [**plot them together** at the end!](http://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaborative_github_exercise/plot_trait_evolution.html) 

- We'll also **discover the skull and beak shapes** associated with each simulated species size.
