## Add markdown to your Repository

1. On your computer, create a file in your repository called `index.md`. index is always the entry point to any website - the "Default" webpage.

2. Add some content - perhaps this could be your to-do list or a "Welcome to my homepage" page if you like. Save it and commit it to your repository, then push to GitHub.

## Enable the website component

Now you need to **enable GitHub Pages** in order to see it turn into a live website.

1. On your GitHub repository, go to the settings (top rightish tab with a cog icon).

2. Scroll down to the `GitHub pages` section. Under `Source`, select `master branch` or `main branch` and press save.

3. You can also select a theme if you like!

4. Once this is done, you should see a green message saying _"Your site is published at_ **some-link.github.io**_"_. Click on it - and ta-da! You have a website.
