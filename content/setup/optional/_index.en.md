### Git

If you wish to install Git and use it outside of GitKraken, for example at the command line, please refer to the
[official installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).


### R

During the collaborative exercise, we will collate materials from each participant which will feed into an R
analysis. If you would like to run this analysis yourself locally, you will need to have
**[R](https://www.r-project.org)** and **[Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.coim)** installed. This however is optional and
not a requirement for you to complete the workshop.

R can be downloaded [here](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).

### RStudio
RStudio is an environment for developing R code.

It can be downloaded [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
You will need the Desktop version (> 1.0) for your computer.
