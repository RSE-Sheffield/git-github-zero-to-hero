You will also need an account at [github.com](https://github.com/). 

#### Getting a GitHub account

Basic GitHub accounts are free. Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For example, you may want to review these [instructions for keeping your email address private](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/) provided at GitHub.

I personally prefer to use a non-institutional email for registering accounts to platforms I want smooth access to regardless of affiliation. However, there are advantages associated with affiliation with an academic institution on GitHub, namely that you get a free [developer (PRO) account](https://github.com/pricing). The most **important benefit of that is that it gives you unlimited public AND private** repositories. You **can however add your academic email as a secondary email** which will allow you to benefit from this academic research discount. You can also just use your academic address from the start and just change it once you move on.
