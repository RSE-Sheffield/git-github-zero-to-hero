<h3>Integrating GitKraken Client with GitHub</h3>
<p>In order to effectively work with GitHub repositories through GitKraken Client, you will need to <strong>enable the integration and authenticate with GitHub</strong>. You can then use GitKraken Client to <strong>define or generate an <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent">SSH key</a></strong> that authenticates git operations on GitHub through GitKraken Client. Follow <a href="https://support.gitkraken.com/integrations/github/">the instructions on the GitKraken Client site</a> to perform both steps.</p>

<h3>Turn off GPG</h3>
<p>GPG adds another layer of trust to your commits by <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work">allowing you to digitally signing them</a>. We’ll not explore this topic further in this workshop so please <strong>check your GPG settings under <kbd>preferences</kbd> and ensure the "Sign Commits by Default" and "Sign Tags by Default" options are unchecked</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/gpg_off.png" /></p>
<p>If you want to set GPG signing up in GitKraken Client, have a look at the documentation on <a href="https://support.gitkraken.com/git-workflows-and-extensions/commit-signing-with-gpg/">Commit Signing with GPG</a>.</p>
