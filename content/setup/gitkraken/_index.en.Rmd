### Install GitKraken Client

To install **GitKraken Client** download the correct binary for your system.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://gitkraken.com/download")
```


Then follow the [installation instructions](https://support.gitkraken.com/how-to-install/) provided on their website. 

{{% notice note %}} 
_In the installation instructions you'll see that you do not actually need to install **Git** separately to use
GitKraken Client as it ships it's own Git framework, NodeGit, which is primarily developed and maintained by members of
the GitKraken development team._

### Integrating GitKraken Client with GitHub

In order to effectively work with GitHub repositories through GitKraken Client, you will need to **enable the integration and authenticate with GitHub**. You can then use GitKraken Client to **define or generate an [SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)** that authenticates git operations on GitHub through GitKraken Client. Follow [the instructions on the GitKraken site](https://support.gitkraken.com/integrations/github/) to perform both steps.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://support.gitkraken.com/integrations/github/")
```


### Turn off GPG

GPG adds another layer of trust to your commits by [allowing you to digitally signing them](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work). We'll not explore this topic further in this workshop so please **check your GPG settings under <kbd>preferences</kbd> and ensure the "Sign Commits by Default" and "Sign Tags by Default" options are unchecked**.

If you want to set GPG signing up in GitKraken Client, have a look at the documentation on [Commit Signing with GPG](https://support.gitkraken.com/git-workflows-and-extensions/commit-signing-with-gpg/).
