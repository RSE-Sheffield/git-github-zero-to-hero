# Software Requirements

This workshop assumes you have **GitKraken Client** installed on your computer and a personal **GitHub** account.


[***GitHub** (i.e. github.com)](https://github.com/). To work on GitHub you will need a [supported](https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/) web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari, or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).

**GitKraken Client** is a powerful and elegant multiplatform graphical interface for Git developed as an alternative to working with Git from the command line.

**Git** is a version control system that lets you track who made changes to what when and has options for easily
updating a **shared or public version of your code on**. You do **not** have to explicitly install Git in order to
participate in this course because **GitKraken** includes it. If however you wish to use Git outside of GitKraken there
are instructions on how to do so.
