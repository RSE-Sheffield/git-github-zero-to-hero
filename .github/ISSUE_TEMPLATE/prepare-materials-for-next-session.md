All instructors (lead and support) need to do some preparation (especially to repos in their own accounts) if they have created materials during a previously run course. Lead instructor has some extra prep steps.

Complete as necessary (dependant in what has been created in the past). Tick off tasks as they are completed or if they are not required.

- [ ] Delete `git-lesson` repo from instructor's GitHub account. Delete local copy if you want to use same location for demo.
- [ ] Delete `collaborative_github_exercise` fork repo **FROM INSTRUCTOR'S ACCOUNT ONLY**. Do NOT delete the RSE-Sheffield original repo.  Delete local copy (of fork!) if you want to use same location for demo. 
- [ ] [LEAD INSTRUCTOR] Clear previously submitted parameter files from `params/` folder in `RSE-Sheffield/collaborative_github_exercise` repo. DO NOT DELETE `params_tmpl.R`. Synch local and remote repos.
- [ ] Delete `python-calculator` repo from instructor's account. Delete local copy if you want to use same location for demo.
