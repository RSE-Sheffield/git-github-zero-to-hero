The lead instructor needs to schedule events on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com) using the [RSE
Sheffield](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/rse-sheffield-29660305889) organisation. If you have not already been setup as
an administrator for this you should request to be included by another team member (see [RSES
Handbook](https://github.com/RSE-Sheffield/rses-handbook/blob/master/pages/eventbrite.Rmd) for further details).

A banner can be added to the event, some sample images are under the `resources/` directory of this repository.

The following fields should be entered into each field on the **Details** page (they can be copy and pasted from a past event).

### Summary


> This is an introductory course, teaching the git and GitHub skills required to manage research code over it's
> development lifecycle.

### Description

> How can we effectively work together on the same code?
> This is an introductory course, teaching the git and GitHub skills required to manage research code over itâ€™s development lifecycle. These skills are essential for collaborative research teams.
> This event is for University of Sheffield researchers and research students only. Please register with an @shef.ac.uk
> or @sheffield.ac.uk email address to ensure your ticket request is accepted.
>
> **Prerequisite skills***: Some programming experience.
>
> ### Learning Objectives
> - Version controlling your own project through Git & GitHub.
> - Basic collaboration through forks on GitHub.
> - Advanced team collaboration through branches on GitHub.
> - Using the GitKraken GUI for a smooth version control experience.
>
> This course will be run online.
>
> We are delighted to be able to make free at point of use training available to the research community, to enable
> better software and more open, reproducible research. However, free at point of use training is not free. The cost of
> a course can easily run to thousands of pounds, if preparation costs are taken into account.
>
> If you sign up for a course, please make sure you either attend or cancel your booking. Bookings can usually be
> cancelled using eventbrite.com or, failing that, by emailing rse@sheffield.ac.uk.
>
> Running courses that are not fully attended wastes our funding (which is provided by taxpayers, charities and
> students, amongst others) and reduces our collective capacity to improve research outputs and researcher experiences.
>
> Persistent failure to attend booked courses might result in you being excluded from future training opportunities.
>
> If we can do anything to make our courses more accessible for you to attend, please send suggestions to
> rse@sheffield.ac.uk; the Sheffield RSE Team are committed to making our training as accessible to a wide range of
> researchers as possible.
